## Problem Statement

### Challenge
Urban areas face increasing air pollution challenges, but citizens and city planners lack access to real-time, actionable air quality insights. Traditional monitoring systems provide delayed, fragmented data that doesn't enable proactive health protection or informed decision-making.

### Impact
- **Health Risks:** Citizens can't make informed decisions about outdoor activities
- **Urban Planning:** City managers lack real-time data for traffic and energy optimization
- **Environmental Policy:** Delayed data hinders rapid response to pollution events
- **Economic Cost:** Poor air quality reduces productivity and increases healthcare costs

### Current Limitations
- Most systems use simulated or delayed data
- Limited integration between different data sources
- Lack of predictive analytics and anomaly detection
- Poor user experience with complex, technical interfaces

## Proposed Solution

### Smart City Big Data System
We propose developing a comprehensive **real-time air quality monitoring and analytics system** that:

1. **Processes Big Data:** Handles 162,000+ data points daily from 11,000+ global monitoring stations
2. **Provides Real-time Insights:** Delivers immediate air quality updates and health recommendations
3. **Implements Advanced OOP:** Demonstrates mastery of object-oriented programming principles
4. **Enables Predictive Analytics:** Uses machine learning for traffic, health, and energy predictions
5. **Offers Modern UX:** Provides intuitive, responsive web interface with real-time updates

### Technical Approach

**Big Data Processing:**
- **Volume:** 15+ cities × 15 data points × 720 cycles/day = 162,000+ data points daily
- **Velocity:** Real-time API integration with 30-second update cycles
- **Variety:** Air quality indices, weather data, health recommendations, traffic predictions
- **Veracity:** Government monitoring stations, embassy sensors, verified API sources

**OOP Architecture:**
- **15+ Classes:** Complete service layer with analytics, data processing, and management classes
- **5+ Interfaces:** Abstract contracts for data processors, stream handlers, and analytics providers
- **Multiple Design Patterns:** Factory, Observer, Command, Singleton patterns
- **3+ Inheritance Levels:** Base → Abstract → Concrete class hierarchies
- **Exception Handling:** Custom exception classes with structured error management
- **Enumerations:** Type-safe constants for device types, statuses, and alerts
