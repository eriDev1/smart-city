## Project Assignment

Implement an application in an innovative field of your choice. Here are some alternatives:

### 1. OOP Application  
Include the following object-oriented assets:
- At least **5 interfaces/abstract classes** (with one or more implementations)
- At least **15 classes** (implementing the application logic)
- At least **1 exception class** (with usage in your code)
- At least **3 levels of inheritance depth**
- At least **1 polymorphism usage**
- At least **1 enumeration**
- At least **1 architectural style**
- At least **3 design patterns** (e.g., Composite, Singleton, Factory, Wrapper, Bridge, Command, Iterator, etc.)

### 2. Big Data, Grid Computing, Blockchain, or Peer-to-Peer Application  
  - Independent management of computing resources
  - Intelligent and transparent resource selection
  - Understanding of resource load, availability, and configuration
  - Failure detection and failover
  - Security mechanisms for access and integrity  

- **Big Data**: Analyze or process data too large for traditional systems.

## General Requirements

Your project is an opportunity to dive deeply into advanced programming. You are expected to:
- Show knowledge of **object-oriented** or **emerging paradigms**
- **Divide modules** among team members (but everyone should understand the full code)
- Use and improve **open-source** applications (strongly recommended)
- Conduct **research** on similar approaches

---

## Additional Requirements

- Follow **best practices** in OO design:
  - Data encapsulation
  - Proper exception handling
  - Correct usage of inheritance, abstraction, and polymorphism
  - Strong cohesion and loose coupling
- Use a **versioning system** (e.g., [GitHub](https://github.com/)) for collaboration
- Optionally, provide a **class diagram** for your types

---

## Non-Required Work

The project **does not need to be fully complete** or perfect. It is primarily for educational purposes:
- Learn **advanced programming** skills in a real-world setting
- Gain experience in **teamwork** and **Git collaboration**

---

## Deliverables (ZIP File Submission)

One team member should submit a ZIP archive containing:

### 1. Project Proposal (1-2 pages)
- Describe the team members
- Define the problem you plan to solve
- Outline your solution and what you plan to deliver

### 2. Source Code

### 3. Project Report (Conference Paper Format)
- Application Name
- Team name and list of team members
- Project purpose – what problem do you solve?
- Optional: class diagram
- Related works – advantages of your approach
- Code fragments (important logic)
- Screenshots of the UI
- GitHub repo URL (do not delete it)
- Any other optional information  
- Follow the template on Moodle

### 4. Optional: PowerPoint Presentation for Project Defense

---

## Public Project Defense

You will present your work publicly. You have **20 minutes**, no more.

### In your presentation:
- Demonstrate the application (briefly)
- Show the class diagram (glance)
- Browse the source code on GitHub
- Show Git commit logs (to verify each team member's contribution)
- Optionally: prepare 3–4 slides PowerPoint

**Important Notes**:
- Be strict with time
- Bring your own laptop
- Test the projector beforehand
- Open everything in advance to save time

---

## Teammate Feedback

You will be asked to provide **feedback about each teammate**, including:
- Technical skills
- Attitude
- Teamwork and contribution

This feedback is an important part of the **final project evaluation**.
